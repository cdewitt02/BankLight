# Thoughts:

## What it does well:
- SQL RAG is happening
- Integrates with DropBox web hook
- Ok RAG classification

## Needs:
- Transaction parsing special cases (e.g. Amex and fidelity in frost files)
- Better RAG classification
- Better system prompts
- Need a bigger and better model
- Need SVT

## Stretch:
- Run dropbox listener on RPI and sync with model server's db
